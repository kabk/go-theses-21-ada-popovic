        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p><span class="hashtag">#MEREL_1
            I tried my best to cool down the abstract, but it still feels very stiff and robotic, not sure if I should leave it so. Also, should I talk more about methods here?</p>
</span>
          <p>In the following text I analyse how the way we classify the knowledge stored by us in the digital world impacts our perception of the physical world. Starting with the ancient loci method and ending with the bookmarking websites, I
            present how the process of alienating our memory from biological minds to machinal storage spaces has emerged. To show the potential of idiosyncratic methods of organisation within them, I provide an in-depth analysis of the
            channel-naming landscape of the Are.na platform. By presenting examples of artistic and literary experiments in re-classification, I suggest how much a reconsideration of prevailing categories can induce questioning of reality and its
            workings. Finally, I outline the benefits of living in a meaningful and personal digital environment and as a replacement of standardised taxonomy, I propose a naming method of 'taxopoetry' which encourages an imaginative use of language
            and use of the naming process as a means of creative self-discovery.

                I was thinking about deleting the whole first paragraph (the part between {}), I don't feel it gives any important guidance or factual information, but I am also not confident with starting with the second paragraph instead. You
                mentioned you might have some sources to help me out here historically, but I am doubting it even then. I like the first sentence about 'exceeding mnemonic capabilities'. I think generally I need some form of an introduction here,
                maybe I should add it not at the beginning of the chapter but before it? Not sure what should be there, still very concerned about my abstract, intro and conclusion in general...</p>

                {We tend to not realise how much the way we store and especially categoriseinformation has direct implications on our understanding of the world. There areconsequences to storing information outside of our own minds and retrieving
                thatinformation most usually requires the use of some form of word search – hencecontinuous reliance on outsourced mind asks for evaluation of how it is categorised.} </p>
</span>
                  <p>{There came a point in history where the amount of human knowledge started exceeding mnemonic capabilities of a single mind. As it usually happens with such ephemeral historical events, that moment is difficult to capture. It
                    could
                    be the era of the first Sumerian clay cuneiform pads<sup><a href="#fn1-27066" id="fnr1-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. It could be the time of the refinement of the alphabet<sup><a href="#fn2-27066" id="fnr2-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
                    in the Ancient Greece and resulting slow transformation from oral to written culture. In any case, we started outsourcing our memory and by the time Gutenberg arrived with his first press, a multitude of techniques for more or
                    less
                    permanent memory storage have emerged.}</p>

                  <p>How can you recognise a character gifted with an exceptional mind in a mainstream movie series? Simple. By their memory palace. Almost every fictional genius – Sherlock, Hannibal, Mentalist – will be portrayed as a master of the
                    loci (latin for &quot;places&quot;) method. Visual possibilities of representing a Memory Palace on the screen or any other popular culture canvas made the proliferation of its concept into a viewer's mind quick and widespread.</p>

                  <p>However, the loci method is by no means a fruit of modern screenwriter's mind. It originated in the Ancient Greece (its invention and development is attributed to a Greek poet Simonides of Ceos), at a time where memory tied to a
                    human mind, not to its paper or digital assistant, was held way more precious than it is today. It was the age of information learned by heart, but not for mere gimmicky show-off we see in modern movies. The Greece of Socrates
                    was
                    the kingdom of long-lost oral culture, the house of rhetoric as an artform. A place where memorising was considered to play a major part in the process of {formulating one's thoughts}. Contemporaries treated the human mind not as
                    an
                    information container, but as a crucible for calcination of new ideas <sup><a href="#fn3-27066" id="fnr3-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. </p>

                    <p>Unsurprisingly, the busy minds of Ancient Greeks became fertile grounds for the loci method popularisation. Its concept is rather easy to grasp. The Mind Palace technique lies in projecting information we wish to memorize onto
                      objects and rooms in an imagined Memory Palace of an individual's design. The space can be anything, not necessarily a palace, but a clearly imagined territory that is characterised by comfort or familiarity. The system is well
                      described on a 'Temple Of Time' visualisation drawn by Emma Willard, a nineteenth century feminist scholar devoted to representation of visual mnemonics<sup><a href="#fn4-27066" id="fnr4-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.
                      Using a structure of a temple Willard, a skilled cartographer, aptly mapped chronology to geography. The method is plain. Centuries (represented by pillars) are tied through colour coding and spatial position to most prominent
                      thinkers of a given age. These are further divided into scientific and artistic categories (statesmen, philosophers, warriors) through natural architectural elements of the temple. A simple system of meaning allows for easy
                      organization of information and lasting memorisation.</p>

                    <p>Many centuries after Simonides, his loci method, or at least its concept, was still in use. In the 16th century Giulio Camillo Delminio worked on his project &quot;Theatro Della Memoria<sup><a href="#fn6-27066" id="fnr6-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup>&quot;
                      in which, by associating information to mental spaces, he wanted to record all of human knowledge. However, there was a change of attitude. Camillo wanted to give his project a physical form. He wanted to build an actual palace
                      for
                      human memory. Unfortunately, as it often happens with grand ideas and their inventors, Camillo struggled financially. Having no luck finding a patron and running out of time, the renaissance thinker only managed to create a
                      wooden
                      model of the Theatre.<sup><a href="#fn7-27066" id="fnr7-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn8-27066" id="fnr8-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Camillo was not the only one who dreamt of giving a physical form to memory. With the arrival of widespread print, improving access to education and paper, humans started outsourcing their memory palaces.
                      That is hardly a surprise – non-physical memory palaces require a substantial time investment in order to become functional (and still might not pay off). Moreover, the more prosthetic (stored outside of a body or mind,
                      physically
                      external) options for knowledge recording appear, the more we tend to lose trust in our own mnemonic capabilities. </p>

                    <p>In the Renaissance one of the more popular solutions to the risks of forgetfulness was a commonplace book <sup><a href="#fn9-27066" id="fnr9-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup>. It was a simple notebook
                      where
                      all things encountered (poems, recipes, conversations) were noted down and stored for later retrieval. A paper-based predecessor to any modern bookmarking platform.</p>

                    <p>About a century ago we have collectively gathered so much that not only a single mind – a whole library wouldn't suffice to store it. An arrival of new informational era was in the air. The great minds of the time felt it and
                      started designing their proposals. Almost a hundred years before the Web as we know it, the rising sea of information was calling for reconsideration of how the cognitive overload was managed. In 1934, Paul Otlet, a visionary
                      archivist, saw it most clearly:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Humanity is at a turning point in its history. The mass of available information is formidable. New instruments are necessary for simplifying and condensing it, or the intellect will never know how to overcome the
                        difficulties
                        which overwhelm it, nor realise the progress that it glimpses and to which it aspires.<sup><a href="#fn10-27066" id="fnr10-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Otlet, like Camillo before him, undertook another mission of recording and storing all of human knowledge in what he called Mundaneum. The partly realised space (initially localised in 150 rooms of the Palais du
                      Cinquantenaire) was
                      supposed to connect libraries, archives, governments, universities and individuals and through the Universal Decimal Classification organize and make available to public the totality of human intellectual achievement. Similarly
                      to
                      what we see in Willard's sketches or Camillo's plans, Otlet wanted the architecture of the Mondotheque to reflect the organization of information stored within it. With the support of the Belgian government and collaboration
                      with
                      architectural giants (such as Le Corbusier), the project was supposed to be realised into a monumental ziggurat <sup><a href="#fn11-27066" id="fnr11-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> – a physical temple
                      of
                      collective intellectual achievement. Nazi regime and the turbulent 1940s rendered the complete realisation of Mondotheque impossible and nowadays the grandeur of Otlet's legacy has been reduced to an archive and exhibition
                      space run
                      by a non-profit organization in Mons, Belgium.</p>

                    <p>A year after Otlet's death, in 1945, Vannevar Bush, an American engineer, inventor and scientist, wrote his seminal article &quot;As We May Think&quot;, in which he suggested that the memory revolution will not happen from
                      within
                      us, but through interaction with machines. He hypothesised a concept of the memex – an electromechanical device that would function as an &quot;enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory&quot; <sup><a href="#fn12-27066" id="fnr12-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup>.
                      The illustration of the idea was built around a humble desk supplemented with screens and complex machinery that would store all the individual's research, books, annotations and records and allow for system of combining
                      information
                      similar to the one happening in human mind – but with reliable storage and seamless retrievability. In both its concept and construction, Bush's memex is pleasingly related to one of Otlet's ideas as well. To allow for easy
                      individual use of what Mundaneum had to offer, Otlet designed Mondotheque – a home multimedia workstation <em>that could be at the same time archive, instrument, workstation, catalog and broadcasting machine<sup><a href="#fn13-27066" id="fnr13-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup></em>
                      and was connected to the universal library of Mundaneum <sup><a href="#fn14-27066" id="fnr14-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. </p>

                    <p>Not long after Otlet pioneering the concept of a search engine and Bush's proto-hypertextual ideas (that inspired legends like Ted Nelson or Douglas Engelbart), an informational miracle they both foresaw arrived. The Internet
                      was
                      finally here. The World Wide Web came to help us navigate the stormy sea of data, promising the infinite storage, eternal archivisation and dawn of the Age Of Information. And we entered it happily and greedily – straight into
                      the
                      Age Of Forgetfulness, where no one has to remember anything. Our prosthetic techno-limbs remember for us. </p>

                    <p>And I am scared. When I want to cite a poem, I just look it up on my phone, it is saved somewhere in the digital notes. I don't take the effort to memorise it, instead of storing it in my mind, I store it on a bookmarking
                      platform.
                      I am anxious about how much I actually KNOW without my many prosthetic assistants. Two decades ago my mom remembered dozens of phone numbers, never relying on a notebook. I, on the other hand, remember only my mom's and my own
                      digits. But then again – is there anything wrong with that? It is a reliable and comfortable solution. Why not use it? </p>

                    <p>We tend to not realise how much the way we store and especially categorise information has direct implications on our understanding of the world. There are consequences to storing information outside of our own minds and
                      retrieving
                      that information most usually requires the use of some form of word search – hence continuous reliance on outsourced mind asks for evaluation of how it is categorised.</p>

                    <p><span class="hashtag">#MEREL_4 Here again, I am thinking about deleting a substantial part of the text. I love this story of Socrates doubting writing, but I am not sure how crucial it is to composition or getting my point
                across. Maybe the previous sentence is a quite fitting ending to the chapter and this last addition feels a bit forced</p>
</span>
                      <p><span class="hashtag">#TALK</span></p>

                      <p>{So far I have merely expressed my doubt about excessive reliance on prosthetic knowledge. In Plato's Dialogues we can find a familiar character, Socrates, who through a short story expresses his distrust towards writing in
                        general:</p>

                      <blockquote>
                        <p>Theut, or Hermes, the alleged inventor of writing, presents his invention to the pharaoh Thamus, praising his new technique that will allow human beings to remember what they would otherwise forget. But the pharaoh is not
                          so
                          satisfied. My skillful Theut, he says, memory is a great gift that ought to be kept alive by training it continuously. With your invention people will not be obliged any longer to train memory. They will remember things not
                          because
                          of an internal effort, but by mere virtue of an external device.</p>
                      </blockquote>

                      <p>Socratic critique of writing is strikingly clear. He believed that a thought alienated from its physical thinker will lose its value, context and credibility. What if Socrates was right? Perhaps writing in general,
                        transforming an
                        internalised memory palace into an outsourced digital note, has led to a complete alienation of knowledge from the mind creating it. As Umberto Eco suggests, <em>Writing [is] dangerous because it decreased the powers of mind by offering human beings a petrified soul, a caricature of mind, a vegetal memory.<sup><a href="#fn15-27066" id="fnr15-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup></em>.
                        <em>Petrified, caricature, vegetal</em> – all these descriptions suggest a loss of aliveness or vibrancy of information that might not have been brought about by writing, but could be possibly introduced by prosthetic
                        organization of
                        human thought. </p>

                      <p>One thing is for sure – no earthly philosophy could stop us from indulging in the prosthetic craze even further. As of 2020 Pinterest has 442 million monthly active users worldwide<sup><a href="#fn16-27066" id="fnr16-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup>.
                        In the Internet Age each one of us can build their digital memory palace or online mondotheque without being inhibited by physical space, architectural or financial constraints. Giulio Camillo Delminio could realise his
                        &quot;Theatro
                        Della Memoria&quot; with a standard laptop and a decent internet connection. And surely, similarly to us, regular web dwellers, he would take his chance in doing do.}</p>

                      <h2>Modern Bookmarking</h2>

                      <p>Throughout the years bookmarking arose as the solution for effectively storing the material encountered online. The invention of a computer changed everything about information storage. The Desktop Metaphor took us from
                        physical <em>folders</em>
                        to 2D icons, from cork <em>boards</em> to their Pinterest descendants, from dreams of memex and mondotheque to reality. Instead of idiosyncratic methods for finding back the archived knowledge, everyone with a computer
                        suddenly had
                        an access to a retrievable and searchable ocean of information. </p>

                      <p>And as it often happens with humanity, we have pushed it too far. The quantity of information storming us on a daily basis is overwhelming, yet we crave it anyway. We hoard it and are addicted to leaving 'for later'.
                        'To-Watch' or
                        'To-Read' lists are strangers to nobody. </p>

                      <p>Soon enough, seizing the market need, many companies released what could be called a Knowledge Management Platform or a Social Bookmarking Service. From <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> of 2003, through <a href="https://pinterest.com/">pinterest.com</a>
                        in 2009, to one of the most recent – <a href="https://www.are.na">are.na</a> of 2014, in the last two decades websites allowing users to save all the texts, websites, images and videos they stumbled upon in the World Wide Web
                        started
                        springing up like organisational mushrooms after a long info-rain.</p>

                      <p>At first glance, all the different platforms seem like an info-hoarder's paradise. They provide infinite storage space (often for free), allow for browsability and searchability, give structure to user's contents and even
                        suggest
                        other web ephemera that might be in user's field of interest. </p>

                      <p>However, at a second glance, the design of all the platforms is disappointingly ubiquitous. After all, the infrastructure of prosthetic knowledge spaces influences the infrastructure of our minds. And yet, this is what we
                        get:</p>

                      <p>Light background, grid, tagged categories. Coloured rectangles all over. A structure reminiscent of Jacque Tati's cubicle offices in <em>Playtime</em>. Users have no decision over how their channel (board, collection, folder
                        – each
                        platform carries their own synonym) is displayed. There is not much place for idiosyncratic organization systems, because the platforms have a standardised structure and, as it is the case with Pinterest, the platform even
                        adds their
                        own tags and labels to any connection, so that its AI can easily recognise, categorise and recommend any piece of information to another user whose &quot;interest field&quot; it might fall into. </p>

</span>
                        <p>It needs to be acknowledged that from the technological point of view those are necessary organisational measures, rendering hosting a userbase numbering in thousands or even millions possible. And yet, with all the ways
                          in which
                          the social bookmarking platforms position themselves as a very personal, &quot;your&quot; space on the Internet, one must question the amount of autonomy and control over the content that is given to the user. The system is
                          not
                          custom-made to fit the needs of human memory, but to serve searchability and retrievability functions of a machine. Before the age of the Internet, during the reign of the commonplace book, people had to come up with their
                          own
                          classification methods, centering their prosthetic knowledge infrastructure around the idiosyncratic ways in which their mind intuitively works. By now machines became a basic organisational tool of our reality. They
                          operate on
                          zero-one calculations, which means that every time we put something into the digital we need to translate it into the binary, so that the machine can understand. The computer world requires an unambiguous tagging systems of
                          what it
                          is supposed to be able to find back later. </p>

                        <p><span class="hashtag">#GRAPH1</span></p>

                        <p>And here lies the cognitive problem. Our reality is far from binary. The disambiguation process all the information goes through before entering the digital world, impact us when we intake that information and take it back
                          into
                          reality. Through interaction with a digital prosthetic memory, our mind is in a way dehumanised of its ambiguous qualities. It is pre-gridded, pre-coded , pre-classified and conditioned to categorise like a machine even
                          after leaving
                          the digital realm. Making us slowly lose the ability to conceptually grasp the grey areas of the world. </p>

                        <p>Is there then a hope for autonomy under the machinal regime of bookmarking? In an environment so hostile to creation, there is but one unexpected bastion of complete user freedom. The collection names. It is only through
                          the input
                          fields that the user can express himself, give context, gain ownership of the gathered material.</p>

                        <p>Creating a new board or a channel is a relatively simple task. However, just between the two platforms of Pinterest and Are.na, many differences can be found. </p>

                        <p>First of all: the spatial terminology. It goes beyond the spatiality of the concept in the name itself (physical 'arena' is to which 'Are.na' hints, being an architectural piece a with purpose of collective display and
                          personal
                          entertainment relates beautifully to the concepts of the digital 'Are.na'). Name such as 'Are.na' seems to, at least superficially, operate on a higher level of conceptual refinement, relating personal knowledge base to a
                          big spatial
                          concept, a possibility financially unattainable for an average citizen. That decision is of importance that should not be overlooked. As George Lakoff and Mark Johnson point out in <em>Metaphors We Live By</em>, humans tend
                          to treat
                          the concept of their spatial positioning as one of the most basic linguistic structures of understanding the world around them <sup><a href="#fn17-27066" id="fnr17-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></sup>.</p>

                        <p>Contrary to Are.na, Pinterest chooses a two-dimensional metaphor. It is an easy translation of basic, feasible reality. Anyone can have a simple pinboard, it is cheap enough and achievable without the rich imaginative
                          possibilities
                          of the digital environment. A 'channel' however, that presents the user with some spatial grandeur, comparing knowledge repository to a piece of architecture (taking us a little back to the similarly architectural memory
                          palace
                          method)
                          Building a space is a grander gesture than pinning notes to a cork (or pixel) board.</p>

                        <p>As shown on fig.x, when a user wants to create a new board on Pinterest, he is already nudged in a direction of a type of a name he should give to his board (&quot;places to go&quot;, &quot;recipes to make&quot;). Such
                          suggestion
                          might seem minor, but it instantly positions the user in a subordinate position towards what kind of content is expected or native to the platform<sup><a href="#fn18-27066" id="fnr18-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a></sup>.
                          The completely empty (empty as in non-suggestive, conceptually neutral) input field of Are.na might frighten some users with its unlimited possibility, but for many more it encourages naming the channel in whatever way
                          desired.
                          Another curiosity found on Are.na is the small, barely visible grey dot on the right side of the input field, on which I will elaborate later. </p>

                        <p>Apart from the main input field, the difference between Pinterest and Are.na can be seen in what is suggested by the platform to complete the name. In the case of Pinterest, the website suggests adding a date – something
                          way more
                          quantitive and machine-oriented than a field of &quot;Description&quot; offered by Are.na. </p>

                        <p>The final element of setting up a new channel is deciding the level of its privacy. Pinterest gives two options: Public (everyone can see the content) or Closed (only the creator can see the content) , while Are.na offers
                          Open (a
                          collaborative novelty in which everyone can see and add the content), Closed (everyone can see the content, only the creator can change it) and Private. </p>

                        <p>It seems that Are.na is a platform that already took some well-thought-through steps towards providing a structure that improves on its predecessors (such as Pinterest) and using its highly designer/researcher oriented
                          userbase,
                          open more mindful ways of navigating the internet. Furthermore, the channel names, which are the main focus point of the following analysis, seem to play a more central role on Are.na than on any other platform. A channel
                          is not
                          represented by a collage of miniatures of its contents, but by the name its creator gave it (see below). Name is king. All the above mentioned arguments and perhaps a hint of personal bias (Are.na is my tool of choice for
                          digital
                          hoards) are the reasons behind the continuation of my analysis within the environment of Are.na.</p>

                          <h2>Naming Systems Of Are.na</h2>

                          <p>Let us start with a formality of an introduction. What exactly is Are.na? It seems to be a phenomenon that even Are.na's very creators have always struggled to define. A whole open channel has been devoted to trying to
                            characterise what the platform really is. In the description we can read a note from Charles Broskoski (one of many Are.na's founders):</p>

                          <blockquote>
                            <p>One thing we have struggled with since Are.na was founded is how to describe it. I'm curious how other active members of Are.na describe it to their friends.</p>
                          </blockquote>

                          <p>On &quot;** How do you describe Are.na at a party?<sup><a href="#fn19-27066" id="fnr19-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></sup>&quot; we can find a selection of definitions provided by different users,
                            which I
                            divided into four categories:</p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>Traditional or literal attempts at defining the platform:

                              <ul>
                                <li><em>Research as leisure activity</em></li>
                                <li><em>An electronic commonplace book</em></li>

                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Definitions emphasising the importance of community on Are.na:

                              <ul>
                                <li><em>pinterest for people like us</em></li>
                                <li><em>It's like a research-based Pinterest. But not just images. And instead of moms, its userbase is mostly artists.</em></li>
                                <li><em>Minimal social bookmarking, built by friends.</em></li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Highly referential definitions, comparing the platform to what is known on the web already:

                              <ul>
                                <li><em>Like Pinterest but for people who aren't 16 year old girls</em></li>

                                <li><em>elitist pinterest</em></li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Poetic ones:

                              <ul>

                                <li><em>my second brain</em></li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>As writer Katharine Schwab notices, &quot;this difficulty in describing exactly what Are.na is has become part of its allure<sup><a href="#fn20-27066" id="fnr20-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup>&quot;.
                            However, in its most boiled-down, simplified definition, Are.na is a social bookmarking platform. It relies on a clean and simple design and a lack of ads. Its creators and developers are an active part of the community,
                            which is
                            invited to build the platform with them through suggestions shared on a Slack group or direct contact on the open channels. Are.na's userbase consists mostly of artists, designers and researchers, who take a very
                            curatorial
                            approach to what is added to the platform, where it is stored and how it is labelled, thus providing a surprising quality of relevant content, for which the platform is highly praised by its audience.</p>

                          <table>
                            <colgroup>

                          <p>Hopefully, by now the concept of what Are.na is has become fairly familiar. I believe that the inspiring environment that Are.na's users are so grateful for has been largely achieved through the peculiar naming systems
                            within the
                            platform. In order to show that, an in-depth individual channel analysis has to be conducted.</p>

                          <p>By default, the first thing a viewer can see about the channel is its name and name of the channel's creator. That results in a striking difference between a grid of Are.na channels and Pinterest or Weheartit
                            collections. </p>

                          <p>On Are.na the name of a channel is in a way its most important identifier. The designers of the platform chose not to show a miniature of its content (as opposed to many other social bookmarking websites), but use the
                            seductive
                            character of channel's nomenclature as a click incentive. The name is not a mere label, but an important signpost for the user encountering a channel. The name is the only tool helping the user in making the decision of
                            whether he
                            should or should not enter the collection. Hence, the user-channel encounter happens as follows:</p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>The viewer sees the channel's name, without any idea of its visual contents.</li>
                            <li>He makes an assumption about the contents of the channel.</li>
                            <li>If he considers the name 'charged' with enough potential to spark his curiosity, he decides to enter its universe.</li>
                            <li>His expectation based on the name can be confirmed or playfully subverted.</li>
                          </ol>

                            <p><span class="hashtag">#MEREL_6</span> I love this whole fragment about bulla and channels, but I have no idea what is the purpose of putting it here. Maybe as a show off of my visual apophenia or trying to present a
                              channel as
                              something more cool and mysterious than it actually is, but I guess that is not convincing enough. You also told me to slow down here and explain, but I am not sure how because I have no idea what is going on actually.
                              I tried my
                              best to connect this bulla chapter to Are.na in the paragraph surrounded by {}, but I am not sure if I succeeded.</p>

                            <p>Such mysterious encounters with encapsulated information have roots way deeper than it might be expected. There is a satisfying visual similarity between the way an Are.na channel is 'packaged' and the way an ancient
                              Sumerian
                              Bulla was constructed. Before writing was invented, trade used to be conducted by very physical means. Sets of clay tokens (equivalent of Are.na's blocks), each representing a different commodity, were exchanged. To
                              avoid their
                              switching or removal, the tokens were put into a hollow clay bulla<sup><a href="#fn21-27066" id="fnr21-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></sup> (equivalent of Are.na's channel). As soon as they were in
                              the sealed
                              bulla, no one could tell what kind or how many of them are stored there, so to allow for easy recognition, their shapes were casted into the sides of the ball, together with an imprint of the bulla's creator<sup><a href="#fn22-27066" id="fnr22-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a></sup>
                              (equivalent of Are.na's username). Later Sumerians realised that the imprinting of the token shape renders both the bullae and the tokens unnecessary and they started carving the previous token symbols into a flat clay
                              tablet
                              instead, thus giving us writing.</p>

                            <p>There is an undeniable conceptual and visual similarity between this ancient box of content and its modern version. It is fascinating to see the crucial artefact from the dawn of our civilisation so pleasantly
                              reflected in a
                              modern social bookmarking website. And it is at least equally intriguing to observe how the digital tokens the users collect (images, texts, videos) are impacting their linguistic 'imprint' on the channel's front
                              surface – its
                              name.</p>

                            <p>{ Are.na's approach to building a channels steers us quite close to the way a bulla was constructed. There are two moments created in both instances. A moment of ownership and a moment of mystery. The human element,
                              the moment
                              of ownership comes from personal imprint of bulla's creator in clay or prominent display of the username on the channel miniature. Mystery is even more important here. One does not interact with the content itself
                              (tokens/blocks), but their half-material substitute (token's imprints/channel names). On the fore of the channel there is a suggestion of its contents expressed through a name – in a bulla that suggestion is a clay
                              imprint of the
                              contained tokens. In both situations that imprint has a dual function. On one hand, it serves as a reminder or a note for the author – so that he remembers what he has put into the bulla or the channel. On the other, it

                              moment of friction for the visitor. He receives the channel-bulla and before opening can judge its contents only by the clay imprint or its equivalent – the name. Through Are.na's channels construction a peculiar
                              dialogue between
                              the author-user and visitor-user emerges. A communication with an ancient origin, frozen in time and space.</p>

                            <p>Are.na has a strong designer/artist/researcher oriented community. Thanks to that proximity of interests, even in an ocean of thousands of channels<sup><a href="#fn23-27066" id="fnr23-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a></sup>,
                              each with its own special name, an interesting set of channel types emerges. </p>

  </figure>

                              <p>Generally, based on content and naming combinations, five channel types can be distinguished: 'Regular', 'Remix', 'Method' (answer seeking and question seeking) and 'Chaotic Energy'.</p>

                              <p>The first kind, 'Regular', is quite obvious and frankly – disappointing. It is, in Charles Broskoski's own words &quot;the only way to misuse Are.na&quot;. This naming convention aligns with predictability,
                                standardisation and
                                'what you read is what you get' rule. It is a case when a user simply labels a channel. A collection of favourite typefaces will be simply 'typography'. A fashion channel is revealed as 'fashion'. And a collection of
                                interesting dinosaur pictures shall be 'Cool dinosaurs'. In this case there is no playful dynamic between the user-author and the user-visitor. It greatly supports searchability and gives the user exactly what he
                                might have
                                expected – if he is looking for illustration moodboard, he gets an illustration moodboard. Any chance for serendipity is squeezed out of the equation. </p>

                              <p>The second type –'Remix' – that's where something more engaging starts to happen. On this visual-maker based platform a few kinds of recognisable channel patterns can be observed. Let us focus on three of them –
                                Fashion
                                Channels, Layout Channels, Illustration Channels – and what kind of names are they given by the users.</p>

                              <p>None of these channels give away any of their contents straightforwardly. Their authors, by means of pun, emojis, inside jokes or domain jargon, put on a performance of alternative names. {It feels like visiting a

                              <p>In a 'Remix' channel the user-visitor can suspect the 'content category' of a channel, such as 'Fashion', but has a chance to firstly, be intrigued by the name or connect it to something unexpected, while the
                                author-user can
                                use the name (such as 'alienCouture') as the clue to reading the intended aura of the channel that goes beyond a limiting label of 'Fashion Channel'. However, the trick of the trade is not to give a channel a
                                completely
                                arbitrary name. The name has to, like a pun, on some more or less abstract level actually relate to the standardised 'content category'. User-authors come up with a variety of methods. There are names describe the
                                content a bit
                                less obviously, such as 'Cute Books' as a name of collection of book layouts. There are plays on mis-spelling the name ('make it fasHiUn'), shortening it ('CLO'), using special signs or numbers ('b000k'), finding word
                                within
                                words ('il(lust)ration'), playing around with related terminology ('spread that shit') or even illustrating the channel's content by emoji ('📖') or typography ('00'). The possibilities are endless and fun to read.
                                The channel
                                authors seem to race against each other in coming up with more and more punny and alternative names that relate to a standardised content category, but at the same time are as far away as possible from it.
                                Incidentally, the
                                further away from the regular label the name is, the more difficult it is for a computer to read. </p>

                                <p>The more strange, poetic and abstract the name, the more non-machinal and hence more human it becomes. All these naming patterns might suggest the community's subconscious revolt against searchability, an
                                  unwillingness to be
                                  'keyworded'. Indeed, if we look at a simple label of 'Book' (for example for a collection of 'Want To Read' list), many possibilities of re-naming it can be immediately thought of. </p>

                                <p><em>Books</em>
                                  <em>books</em>
                                  <em>BOOKS</em>

                                  <em>|3OOk$</em></p>

                                <p>From all these names only the first three are dictionary-ready. Of course, it doesn't mean that the rest is impenetrable for a search engine, surely they can be optimised to be 'findable'. Google Search understands
                                  'B00ks'
                                  or 'b(ooo)k', but not '|3OOk'. Only some level of human-only entry is secured. </p>

                                <p>However, the reason for alternative names doesn't have to be a softcore version of human vs machine warzone. What author-user of these channels does is basically re-naming an existing category, trying to find a new
                                  angle of
                                  looking at 'another layout moodboard'. The user-visitor can still understand what these collections might be about. However, through the name, an interesting edge, certain friction is added that positions him into a
                                  specific
                                  framework of understanding the context of that channel and its creator. Naming is an initiatory gesture that applies context to all the contents of the channel – collected texts, links and visuals. It becomes the
                                  key to
                                  reading the collection. AFter all, the language we use to describe reality, has a great impact on our perception, which was proven in an experiment by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer:</p>

                                <blockquote>
                                  <p>After a group of students watched the same series of traffic accidents, they were asked how fast the cars were going when the accident occurred. When the cars were described as having “contacted” one another, the
                                    students
                                    estimated their speed to be thirty-two miles an hour, whereas another group estimated that the cars were travelling at forty miles an hour when they were described as having “smashed” one another.<sup><a href="#fn25-27066" id="fnr25-27066" title="see footnote" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>A channels names 'I Guess I Should Have A Fashion Channel' not only presents a fashion collection, but also comments on the fact that so many users create a fashion channel of their own. 'Il(lust)ration' gathers a
                                  set of
                                  colourful illustrations, but also suggests a strong fascination, even desire for the images' aesthetic value on the author's side.</p>

                                <p>All the preceding channel examples were all about re-naming a category that has a fairly accurate standardised alternative: 'werabl' relates to a fashion collection, 'b000k' is a designer's layout inspiration.
                                  However, there
                                  are channels that are named in a stimulating ways and yet their content, even after opening, doesn't communicate any obvious label. </p>

                                <p>These channels are from, what I like to call 'Method' channels. They seem to realise the potential of a channel names as a method of either looking for a question or finding an answer to it. Within them we can find
                                  two
                                  types: 'Answer-seeking' and 'Question-seeking'.</p>

                                <p>The first kind are channels that are a little similar to the 'Remix' category. The main difference is that they do not simply collect web items of obvious category such as 'typography'. They are more of a research
                                  project –
                                  a visual essay contextualised by the title. If we look at any channel from 'Remix' category, we can usually recognise what it presents, even if it hides 'fashion' under 'werabl' and 'illustration' under '00'. They
                                  are punny,
                                  playful, innocent and not very deep. However, in case of 'Answer-seeking' channels that hidden behind standardised label simply isn't there. Through the name, a collection of funky furniture turns into a burial
                                  objects
                                  reconsideration ('Concepts For My Tomb') or a set of cute illustration analyses a specific part of image-making culture ('anything could be a mascot'). The channel becomes an alive (alive as in never finished, in a
                                  constant
                                  state of becoming through regular additions of new content) answer to the Question of the user.</p>

                                      <p>The 'Question-seeking' channels are even more vague. They might be just an accidental mystification of a subject or a form of entertainment, but most convincingly they seem to be an exercise in formulating,
                                        first
                                        visually, what the user wants to research. Upon entering the 'cirque' channel, visitor sees little connection to what he understands as a circus. He starts wondering, where does the aura of the 'cirque' lay?
                                        Is it about
                                        a circus-like body movement? Is it the staging of complexity? How about '3 RACOONS IN A TRENCHCOAT'? It is neither a fashion, nor design channel. What kind of atmosphere does it attempt to evoke?</p>

                                            <p>Both types of 'Method' channels have an interesting friction, an aura of unfinished-ness around them. They fully realise the potential of channel names and turn each piece of the collection in a piece
                                              of
                                              exhibitable content by itself. Pick out any image from the 'cirque' channel and add a label of CIRQUE under it. A ready-made poster appears.</p>

                                            <p>So far we have looked at channels that give at least a cloudy idea of what they are really about. But what about a channel with contents such as these?</p>

                                                  <p>What is the standardised name for an amalgamate of memes, out-of-context images and general dirt scooped from under the web rug? There doesn't seem to be a fitting category that could be agreed
                                                    on.
                                                    Inability to categorise such group might be one of its allures. Perhaps there is an attraction to images of, what I like to call, 'Chaotic Energy'. They radiate an aura of chaos and absurd escaping
                                                    any label
                                                    and many users, tired of living in a classified, polarised world, appreciate that. We crave the strange, the in-between. Interestingly, our mind seems to be by nature attracted to oddness. A
                                                    survival method
                                                    of attentiveness to an unusual sight or smell in prevention of danger, manifests at a modern party in an ability to remember the person with an unusual name. That 'odd element' memory bias is wider
                                                    known as
                                                    Von Restorff effect. The 'Chaotic' channels seem to be filled with such 'van restorff' items, taken from different collections. </p>

                                                  <p>More importantly, as those channels present such an unclassifiable mixture of content, they give users a great space for naming. I can call them 'Chaotic Energy', someone will say 'Existence
                                                    expansion' or
                                                    'how to be a human being'. What bigger satisfaction is there than naming what is not named yet? Maybe only reading other user's ideas:</p>
